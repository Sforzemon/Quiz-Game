Create a multiple choice quiz that will have the user go against the clock.
The faster it is answered, the higher the score.
Missed answers remove time, thus lowering score potential

Elements are dynamically created using jQuery to bring up the questions and answer buttons.
I used Modals for the game over screens, as well as input form for the users initials

Press start to begin the quiz and start the timer
There is a highscore button onthe top left that will open a Modal with the leaderboard.

The timer is not shown unless you are in the game, it is hidden until then.
